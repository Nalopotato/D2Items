# D2Items
Diablo 2 item search website

Primary purpose: Filter items based on runes that one finds in order to search for Runewords that contain those particular runes.


Goals:
  -Convert project to MVC
  -Add images for items within a modal popup (when you hover over a member of the item list)
  -Fine-tune styling (low priority)
    -Currently site is one large column.  I'm considering 2 or 3 (span6 or span4)
    -Better looking :hover for textboxes, dropdowns, etc.
    -Better looking pagination buttons
  -Login feature to allow outside users to do data entry for me
    -This requires that I publish the site live, obviously
    -Add privs to logins and research/implement best practices for security
  -Publish the site
  -Continue fine-tuning the search query
    -Implement stat filtering (min/max strength and dex)
    -Mod filter
    -Quality filter
